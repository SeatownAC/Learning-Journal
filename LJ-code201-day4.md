I did some painful coding mistakes while trying to create while loop and proper else-if statements. Also, really screwed things up with Git. Eventually got code to work after several hours, neck hurts. I nested my git files inside of each other instead of making individual folders in the proper places. Revised past code to get full points by numbering questions in my if statements per TA request.
