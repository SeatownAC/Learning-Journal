It's Wednesday, but it feels like Saturday. It's good to be here coding with other people, even though it's very fast paced and at times I fear falling behind. Things have been great so far, but with the warning that it's going to get faster, I'm a little nervous for what lies ahead. Today I learned in CSS if you put * before any commands it means that it will cover all content, so the usual rules of heretigae on CSS do not apply. Also, I made a couple new repositories, which is good practice for me as I am not comofrtable with Git yet. We reviewed another classmate's code, which was way cleaner and better than mine, which is a good reminder to think before typing or maybe write it out.
